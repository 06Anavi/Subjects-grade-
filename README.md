Aim -
To write a C++ program that accepts marks for three subjects, calculates the average, and determines the corresponding grade based on the average score.

Theory-
This program demonstrates basic input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and conditional statements in C++.

    Input/Output: Uses cin to accept user input for three subject marks and cout to display results.

    Arithmetic Operation: Calculates the average by summing the three marks and dividing by 3.0 (floating-point division ensures decimal accuracy).

    Conditional Statements: Uses if-else if ladder to assign grades based on average marks:

        Grade A for average ≥ 90

        Grade B for average ≥ 80 and < 90

        Grade C for average ≥ 70 and < 80

        Grade D for average ≥ 60 and < 70

        Grade F for average < 60

This flow control allows the program to categorize the student's performance effectively.

Conclusion-

The program successfully takes three subject marks as input, computes their average, and outputs a grade according to defined criteria. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as user input, arithmetic operations, and decision-making in C++. Such a grading system can be extended or modified easily to fit different criteria or additional subjects.
